    "## Re-fit method:\n",
    "\n",
    "This method tries to combat the CodeBook collapse, i.e(dead codes phenomenon where only a small subset of codes are used by the encoder from the whole codebook), it was first introduced in the paper : https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.01799\n",
    "\n",
    "In the best scenario, We want our codeBook to be initialized in a manner where it has a prior on our dataset, so the codes and the encoders outputs are more alligned, hence the distances between them isn't that huge, The idea proposed in the article is simple : take a pre-trained Vq-Vae trained on a random intilialised codebook, then do a pass through all the dataset and encode allthe images using the encoder, we end by a huge matrix, then we apply a K-means on all the vectors to take the centroids, and train a new model whose codebbok is initialized with those centroids."
